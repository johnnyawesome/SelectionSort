SelectionSort is a  [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm). It lets you sort all kinds of things, like the randmomly generated bars in the image above.

## More information

I blogged about this project and how it's code works [here](https://breaksome.tech/sorting-algorithm:-selectionsort-and-insertionsort/).
It's a nice step-by-step tutorial that walks you through the project and explains the whole code one bit at the time.

I also made a project that supports these three sorting algorithms all in one project:

- BubbleSort
- SelectionSort
- Insertion Sort

You can find it [here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/MultiSort).
